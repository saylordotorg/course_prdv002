### Course Information

Welcome to PRDV002, Professional Writing.  General information about
this course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Mary Morley Cohen, PhD  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a variety of free,
online resources.  The course makes primary use of the following
materials:  

-   [*Business Communication for
    Success*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Communication%20for%20Success.pdf)
-   Cain Project in Engineering and Professional Communication’s [Three
    Modules on Clear Writing
    Style](http://cnx.org/content/m17222/latest/?collection=col10551/latest)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
must study the materials provided in each unit and complete the assigned
tasks.  As you will see, the tasks are designed to allow you to develop
and refine a piece of professional writing of your own choosing.  You
will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all resources and read through the information in each
unit.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **3.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory,” which
estimates the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
Although the course is short, you may want to use these advisories to
schedule time on your calendar to complete each unit.  
  
 **Tips and Suggestions: **In order to get the most benefit from this
course, you should choose a writing project to develop as you work
through the course material.  Ideally, this project should be something
that you need to write anyway: a memo for work, an important email, or a
cover letter for a job application.  This project will allow you to
immediately apply and practice the concepts taught in this course.
