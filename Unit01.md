*When you are writing in a professional context, it is essential to
cultivate an awareness and respect for your audience.  Before you begin
writing, you must determine for whom you are writing and why.  Your goal
should be to make your meaning as clear as possible, so your audience

purpose for writing, and to prepare an outline that will help you get
your point across.*

**1.2 Know Your Audience** <span id="1.2"></span> 
**1.2.1 Characteristics of Your Audience** <span id="1.2.1"></span> 
*In most professional settings, your reader will have limited time, and
he will scan the title and the first sentence or two at most to
determine if the message is worth reading.  If he does not find a
compelling reason to continue reading, he will stop before finishing the
document and either set it aside or throw it away.*  
    
 *The best way to avoid this fate is to convince your reader that your
message will give him information that is relevant to him and then to
convey this information as clearly and succinctly as possible.*

**1.2.2 Research Your Specific Audience** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
*Before you begin writing, pause to reflect on the person or people to
whom you are writing.  Do they know you or someone you know?  Are they
expecting to hear from you?*

Before you begin writing, consider what you want your reader to do after
