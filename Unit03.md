**Unit 3: Polishing Your Writing** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this age of instant communication, we have become accustomed to
writing rapidly and reading documents filled with typographical errors,
slang or abbreviations, and other common errors.  While this may be the
standard practice when text-messaging, it is not standard practice in
the business world.  Every piece of writing, no matter how brief, must
be edited.  In this unit, you will learn how to revise your writing so
that it commands respect and attention.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 0.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 0.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 0.25 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Edit documents to remove common errors.
-   Revise documents for different media and audiences.
-   Describe how to maintain a professional tone when writing,
    especially in social media.

**3.1 Editing** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*Carefully read through the information in subunit 3.1 and sub-subunits
3.1.1 through 3.1.7.  Reading through these sections should take
approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.*  
  
 *The goal of the editorial process is to eliminate any distractions and
red flags.  Proofreading will help make you look as careful and
professional as possible.  No matter how convincing your point is, your
reader will not take you seriously if you have glaring errors in your
document.  Although grammar and spell checking programs are useful, they
can sometimes create additional errors or overlook existing mistakes. 
Therefore, it is important to manually edit all important business
documents before you send them to your intended audience.*

**3.1.1 Share with a Friend** <span id="3.1.1"></span> 
*It is virtually impossible to edit one’s own writing.  Why?  Because we
think we know what we wrote, and we tend to see and hear what we think
we wrote rather than the words on the page.  Therefore, it is very
important to edit your work with fresh eyes.*  
    
 *Ask a friend to make a note of any times when he or she got confused
or lost the flow of your argument.  If your friend finds a lot of typos,
do not be embarrassed; it is better that a trusted friend or colleague
sees these errors rather than your boss or potential boss.*

**3.1.2 Self-Editing** <span id="3.1.2"></span> 
*If you do not have someone readily available, then there are several
tricks for looking at your own writing with fresh eyes.  Set your
writing aside for a few hours, or if the document is extremely
important, such as a cover letter for your dream job, then set it aside
for a day or two.  When you read it again, you will likely notice errors
or areas for improvement that you did not see before.  Read your writing
out loud.  Grammatical errors or awkward phrasing should sound wrong to
your ear.  Print out your document and edit with a pen; sometimes a
different medium will reveal mistakes you did not see on the screen.*

**3.1.3 Inconsistent Formatting: Common Problems, Especially in

*When you proofread a resume, pay close attention to your formatting. 
Make sure that your job titles, descriptions, and dates all use the same
formatting and punctuation.*

**3.1.4 Extraneous Information and Words** <span id="3.1.4"></span> 
*Make sure that your sentences are not unnecessarily complicated or

beginning of your sentences.*

**3.1.5 Information Intended for a Different Audience** <span
id="3.1.5"></span> 
*If you are conducting a job search, it is extremely important to
customize everything (e.g. your cover letter and resume) for each job.
 Make sure to use the words that the employer uses in the job
description.  Also, make sure you do not leave in the name of another
company.  Even if you have the most amazing resume in the world, if you
say “I am interested in the position of project manager” when you are
applying for a position called a “project coordinator,” chances are good
that you will not be called for an interview.*

**3.1.6 Incorrect Electronic File Names** <span id="3.1.6"></span> 
*Very frequently, employers receive a resume for a job that has a file
name of some other company or university.  Hiring managers know you are
applying for many jobs; however, you must make them think you want their
job and no others.*

**3.1.7 Maintain Professionalism** <span id="3.1.7"></span> 
*Remember that maintaining professionalism can impact employment
decisions.  Potential employers may easily find information about you on
Facebook and LinkedIn, so make sure you educate yourself about your
privacy settings and your public profiles.  Even if you are confident
that your messages are private, be wary of posting anything that could
compromise your future employment prospects.  Also, make sure that your
posts are clearly written and error-free.  Although Facebook and other
social media sites tend to encourage a more informal writing style, do
not allow spelling and grammatical errors to raise red flags for your
current and future employers and colleagues.*

    Checklist”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PRDV002-3.2-Editing-Checklist-FINAL.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please download and print the linked document.  Read
    through the Editorial Checklist as you edit your document.  Ideally,
    you will read through your document looking for just one or two
    items on the checklist at a time.  This means you will read through
    your document several times.  Keep this document as a resource as
    you edit professional documents in the future.  
      
     Reviewing and editing your document thoroughly should take
    approximately 15 minutes.
