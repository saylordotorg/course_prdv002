*Now that you have determined your audience, crafted your main point,
and created an outline, it is time to draft your document.  In this

reinforce your main point and persuade your audience.  You will also
learn how to eliminate common problems that may distract your reader
from your main point.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Explain how to make a connection with his or her reader.
-   Reinforce your main point in the most strategic locations throughout
    his or her document.
-   Explain how to write using concrete “characters” instead of abstract
    nouns.
-   Effectively use keywords to reinforce his or her point.
-   Identify and avoid ethical problems such as false claims and
    plagiarism.

**2.1 Review Your Outline** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Take 5 minutes to review your outline and your notes about your
audience.  Throughout the drafting process, keep your notes in front of
you, so you keep your audience and your purpose in mind throughout the
process.*

**2.2 Craft Your Message** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*Carefully read through the sub-subunits below subunit 2.2.  At the end
of this section, you will be asked to write a rough draft of your
document.  It should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to read through
this information.*

**2.2.1 Make a Connection** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*As you begin your draft, try to make a connection with your reader.*

**2.2.1.1 Salutations** <span id="2.2.1.1"></span> 
*One of the best ways to connect to your reader is to say his or her
name.  When writing letters or emails, avoid generic salutations, such
as “Hey Guys.”  It is much better to let your reader know the message is
really intended for him or her by using a personalized salutation, such
as Dear Mr. Smith, Dear Mary, etc.  If you address a group of people too
large to list individually, try to capture their identity as best as you
can: Dear Sales Team, Financial Advisors, etc.*

**2.2.1.2 Introductions** <span id="2.2.1.2"></span> 
*If your readers do not know you, consider introducing yourself.  This
does not mean providing your resume, rather you may tell your readers
why they might want to continue reading even though they do not know you
(e.g. “So and so referred me to you,” “I am working on a high-priority
project in the marketing department,” etc.).*

**2.2.2 State Your Point** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Once you have made a brief connection with your reader, you should get
right to the point.  Your point should be addressed in the
first paragraph.*

**2.2.3 Reinforce Your Point** <span id="2.2.3"></span> 
*Now, you will draft the rest of your message to support your main
point.  There are several parts of your message that you will want to
pay special attention to.*

**2.2.3.1 Document Titles and Subject Lines** <span
id="2.2.3.1"></span> 
*If you are writing a document or memo, make sure that your document
title and file names are as descriptive as possible.  Ideally, use terms
or phrases from your main point, which will help alert your reader to
your main idea.  If you are writing an email message, make sure your
subject line captures your main point.  This will make it more likely
that your reader will open your email.  It also makes that specific
e-mail easier to find later.*

**2.2.3.2 Headers** <span id="2.2.3.2"></span> 
*If your document has multiple sections, consider using section headers
that summarize your sub-point and reinforce your main point.*

**2.2.3.3 Topic Sentences** <span id="2.2.3.3"></span> 
*If your document has multiple paragraphs, start each paragraph with a
sentence that summarizes your sub-point and reinforces your main point;
this is known as a topic sentence.  Ideally, your reader should be able
to glean your complete argument by reading only your opening paragraph
and the first sentence of each subsequent paragraph.  In fact, many
readers in business settings do just this in order to save time.*

**2.2.3.4 Key Words** <span id="2.2.3.4"></span> 
*Not only can key words help reinforce your point, they can also make
documents easier to locate later, using search tools in email systems
and on computers.  Also, employers use keywords to recruit and screen
potential candidates.*

**2.2.4 Create a Clear Story** <span id="2.2.4"></span> 
*Do not alienate your reader with unfamiliar jargon.  Rather than making
you sound smart, you may confuse your reader.  However, this does not
mean that you have to dumb down your point.  In fact, the most complex
ideas are best expressed with language that your reader can understand. 
Then, your reader will focus on your argument rather than stopping to
wonder what you are talking about.*
